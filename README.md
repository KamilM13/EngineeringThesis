# Engineering Thesis
Instrument cluster app programmed in C++ and QML to use with CAN bus in electric vehicle Per≈Ça.

Had issues with qrc so in main.qml the variable filepath needs to be changed.

Built with cmake, for use on linux based systems.

Unit tests are commented out in main, so is CAN connection.
